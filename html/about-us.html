                I'd like to introduce myself; my name is Mastar Caesar, and I
                serve as the Chief Executive Officer of Gomywayride Services
                Ltd. I am a Nigerian. Gomywayride Services Ltd. has simplified
                the process of ridesharing in Nigeria, making it more secure,
                more affordable, more reliable, and more convenient. If you are
                a passenger, sharing a ride with someone in their car is a
                convenient option that won't break the bank, and if you are the
                owner of a vehicle, you can make money by renting out your spare
                seats to other passengers as you go from point A to point B.
                Simply download our mobile app for your iOS or Android device,
                and you can start sharing rides in a matter of minutes. Users
                are able to post rides, make reservations, and communicate with
                one another all through the Gomywayride platform. Because we
                place the utmost importance on safety, we have designed the
                platform to include safety features. You can help to the growth
                of the Gomywayride community by providing feedback on the
                experiences of each trip. Gomywayride puts you in touch with
                other people in the neighbourhood. Our members have been
                successful in finding new friends, new houses, and new jobs
                through the Gomywayride Community. Carpooling is an excellent
                way to cut down on your personal carbon footprint and boost
                vehicle occupancy at the same time. The goal of Gomywayride is
                to facilitate travel that is more social, affordable,
                dependable, and environmentally friendly for everyone. After
                being away from Nigeria for twenty years, in 2012 I made my
                first trip back to the country and visited Lagos. This was the
                beginning of this endeavour. Because I wanted to see as much of
                Nigeria as I could, I settled in Lagos and bought a car so that
                I could get around the country more easily.

                <br />
                <br />

                While I was driving up and down the motorways, I picked up a
                number of other travellers. They told me that it was difficult
                to get to other regions of Nigeria without a car, and that the
                only other choice was to ride the public bus, which is sluggish,
                expensive, and time-consuming at the park where we were. These
                buses will have to wait for several hours within the park before
                they are allowed to leave the park since they won't be allowed
                to depart until they are totally full of passengers. Another
                option was to take the controls of a private jet reserved for
                celebrities and high-profile politicians.

                <br />
                <br />
                After that, I searched for a web development project to work on
                so that I could gain expertise. I was curious as to whether or
                not there were any hassle-free choices for carpooling in
                Nigeria, so I did some research on Google to find out about
                them. I made the decision to build a simple website with the
                goal of connecting people who own cars with people who are
                looking for transportation in the same general direction. After
                a few months of preparation, the Gomywayride Services Ltd.
                company was launched.

                <br />
                <br />
                After its first day of operation, the website already had more
                than 10,000 registered users, and word of mouth has been the
                primary driver of its expansion up until the present day. In
                2017, I decided to focus on developing the service into a
                profitable business and so I quit my job and went to Nigeria.
                From 2017 until 2019, I focused my efforts on improving the
                platform, which led to the recruitment of 10,000 new members
                over that time period. I've also developed mobile apps for
                consumers to use on the platform provided by Gomywayride
                Services Ltd. so that they may plan rides.

                <br />
                <br />
                At the halfway point of 2019, I found myself at a fork in the
                road. The product is a success, as there are over 50,000 users
                and 2.6 million kilometres that have been shared. I had
                developed the fundamental idea behind Gomywayride Services Ltd.
                into an online platform for people to prearrange journeys,
                making it possible for thousands of people to travel together on
                the basis of mutual trust. The contributions made by users are
                driving further development of the platform maintained by
                Gomywayride Services Ltd.

                <br />
                <br />
                Our goal is to one day inhabit a society in which vital
                resources are distributed equitably among all people in order to
                protect the natural world. Our mission is uncomplicated: we want
                to make it easier for groups to travel together by filling empty
                car seats. We as humans are obligated to travel for our lives,
                both professionally and recreationally. We become more
                open-minded, tolerant people who are overall better off as a
                result of travel's ability to extend our horizons intellectually
                as well as socially. We believe that the ability to travel is a
                fundamental right and not a privilege. We are confident that
                with the appropriate application of technology and the
                assistance of all of you, we will be able to make travel more
                convenient (accessible, usable, and understood) for all people.
                We are able to achieve this by pairing drivers with passengers
                going in the same direction. By travelling together, we can
                create a new mode of transportation that is friendlier, more
                financially accessible, and less harmful to the environment. We
                make it easier for people to share real-life moments with one
                another in person. I'd like to introduce you to Gomywayride...
                the most popular form of ridesharing available in Africa. IT IS
                ABSOLUTELY FREE TO USE.
